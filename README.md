# Fluid-Sentiment
Visualizing Emotional Textures through a Particle Ecosystem


## About

Fluid Sentiment is a project that aims to translate the sentiment and emotional meaning of words in literary pieces into a visual medium. The generated texture comes from the interactions of a particle ecosystem, where each sentence of the input text is emotionally represented as a particle.

The result of the interactions among particles resembles brush strokes from an expressionistic painting.

Further work revolves around implementing UI and experimenting with different text-provided inputs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites



- Java
- Processing
- Stanford CoreNLP 4.5.7 (comes already installed in the Java SentimentAnlysis script)

### Installation



1. Download Sentiment Analysis script
2. Download Processing Sketch



## Usage

To run the code the first step is to open the data folder inside the Processing sketch data folder. There change the content of the _input.txt_ file to any desired text or literary piece.
Then run the Java SentimentAnalysis script to analyse the sentiment, verb quantity and adjective quantity present in the text.
Finally, run the Processing sketch.


While the Processing sketch is running press 'E' to save the texture on the "Experiences" folder (already contains some previous experiences). Press 'Q' to exit the simulation.


## Additional Information
"Text_Input" contains some text examples used for testing of the system.
